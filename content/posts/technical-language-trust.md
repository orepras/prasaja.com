# When Technical Language Creates Trust, You Can Befriend Jargon!

There's a common belief that plain language is always better, tons of blogs already mentioned it. But when it comes to specialized products and technical solutions, this isn't always the case. Sometimes, the judicious use of technical language can actually enhance credibility and build trust with your audience.

## The Paradox of Plain Language

The push for plain language in technical communication has been well-intentioned. It aims to make information accessible and understandable to everyone. However, this approach can sometimes backfire when dealing with specialized products or technical solutions. Here's why:

- Technical audiences often equate plain language with oversimplification
- Industry professionals expect domain-specific terminology
- Complex solutions sometimes require precise technical vocabulary
- Credibility can be undermined by oversimplified explanations

## When Technical Language Builds Trust

Technical language serves several crucial functions in specialized contexts:

### 1. Demonstrating Domain Expertise

When you use industry-standard terminology correctly, you signal to your audience that you understand their world. This isn't about showing offâ€”it's about speaking their language and showing that you've done your homework.

### 2. Ensuring Precision

Technical terms often carry specific meanings that plain language can't capture. For example:
- "Latency" vs "delay"
- "Throughput" vs "amount processed"
- "Scalability" vs "ability to grow"

### 3. Building Professional Credibility

In specialized fields, the appropriate use of technical language can:
- Establish authority
- Create a sense of professional community
- Demonstrate understanding of industry challenges
- Show respect for the audience's expertise

## Understanding Audience Segmentation

The key to effective technical communication isn't about choosing between technical and plain language, it's about matching the language to your audience's expertise level:

### 1. Technical Decision Makers

For this audience, technical language is essential because:
- They need precise specifications
- They evaluate solutions based on technical criteria
- They communicate with technical teams
- They make decisions based on technical capabilities

### 2. Business Stakeholders

This group often needs a hybrid approach:
- Technical terms for credibility
- Plain language explanations for context
- Business impact explanations
- ROI-focused language

### 3. End Users

For end users, the focus should be on:
- Clear, actionable instructions
- Benefits-focused language
- Minimal technical terms
- Contextual explanations when technical terms are necessary

## Best Practices for Technical Communication

These best practices emerged from my experience developing communication systems and writing documentation for various products. Through trial and error, I've learned that the most effective technical communication comes from understanding both the technical depth of the content and the diverse needs of the audience. Whether I was writing documentation for product team, creating user guides for end users, or crafting proposals for stakeholders, these principles consistently proved valuable in building trust and ensuring clear communication.

### 1. Know Your Audience

Before writing, ask yourself:
- What's their technical background?
- What's their role in the decision-making process?
- What information do they need to make decisions?
- How do they typically communicate in their role?

### 2. Use Technical Terms Strategically

When using technical language:
- Define terms when introducing them
- Provide context for why they matter
- Use industry-standard terminology
  - ISO standards (e.g., ISO 27001 for security, ISO 9001 for quality management)
  - IEEE standards for technical specifications
  - RFC documents for internet protocols
  - Domain-specific standards (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, PCI DSS for payment systems)
  - And for Indonesian industry:
    - SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia) for various technical specifications
    - OJK (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan) standards for fintech and financial services
    - Kominfo regulations for telecommunications and digital services
    - BI (Bank Indonesia) standards for payment systems
    - Kemenkes (Kementerian Kesehatan) standards for healthcare technology
- Avoid unnecessary technical complexity

### 3. Balance Technical and Plain Language

Create a communication hierarchy:
- Lead with the most important information
- Support technical claims with plain language explanations
- Use examples to illustrate complex concepts
  - For fintech: "Real-time payment processing" â†’ "Seperti transfer OVO/DANA yang langsung masuk ke rekening penerima"
  - For e-commerce: "Inventory management system" â†’ "Sistem yang membantu toko online mengatur stok barang seperti Tokopedia"
  - For healthcare: "Electronic Health Records" â†’ "Seperti aplikasi Halodoc yang menyimpan riwayat kesehatan Anda"
  - For logistics: "Route optimization" â†’ "Seperti cara JNE mengatur rute pengiriman agar lebih efisien"
- Provide additional resources or knowledge docs for deeper understanding

## Measuring the Impact

To ensure your technical communication is effective:

1. Track engagement metrics
2. Gather feedback from different audience segments
3. Monitor conversion rates
4. Analyze support ticket volume
5. Conduct user interviews

## Let's Befriend Technical Language

No, nu-uh! Technical language isn't the enemy of clear communication. It's a tool that, when used appropriately, can build trust and credibility with specialized audiences. The key is to match your language to your audience's expertise level while maintaining clarity and purpose.

The goal isn't to impress with technical terms (don't be sok asik with it), but to communicate effectively with your specific audience. When technical language serves this purpose, it becomes an asset rather than a barrier to effective communication.
