I‚Äôve been working with several teams in my workplace, sure it was fun and all. On the first year, I learn a lot about problem-solving and decision making, two things that we often hear in the office environment, organizations, and various fields that are needed to achieve goals effectively without wasting a lot of energy and time.

This article will focus on the discussion of the importance of¬†decision making, whether individual or (collective decision making). Especially in the context of the office environment, which requires always be in a demanding situation in the formulation of the plan.

The process of formulating the plan will be relatively simpler if a decision can be made by a single self. However, it would be more complicated if the decision should be made and discussed with others, in this case, the work team.

Decisions generated together with more teams can combine many aspects such as data and experience, as well as diverse opinions. Although it takes longer, the resulting decision is also more likely to be implemented because of shared responsibility.

Innovative and effective are the benchmarks for good decisions, but if there is no commitment to running them like many abandoned personal decisions, then the decision is useless.
Here are the benefits of decision making collectively (together).

## Fresh ideas

Each person who contributes does have a separate idea, but some of them must have fresh ideas sticking out and triggering other participants to think more freshly. Even in addition to fresh ideas that arise, there is also a strange idea that can be considered in the future.

## Minimize misunderstandings and biases

I‚Äôm sure each team member has his or her own bias, especially when it includes a hobby or a favorite thing during the discussion. From the decision-making process collectively, the bias carried by each team member can be merged and become a solution.

## Facilitate implementation

To implement most of the decisions the team has set, it takes a lot of effort. With the role that each team member has, it will facilitate the realization of the solution.

> There are many more benefits of decisionmaking collectively, but not all decisions must be made in teams or collectively.

With this, hopefully, your team can better appreciate the process of decision making collectively which is taking up more time and energy. It‚Äôs all for the sake of quality outcomes and strengthening relationships among team members.
