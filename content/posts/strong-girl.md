I never thought I’d write something like this.

A few months ago, my 2.5-year-old daughter, Nada, had bleeding in her ear and a small lump just under it. At first, we thought it was just a swollen lymph node. But after a biopsy, the initial diagnosis came back as Ewing Sarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer that usually affects bones or soft tissue. We went straight to a cancer hospital, determined to fight with everything we had.

But there is a further diagnosis that we have to wait for quite a long time, and the latest diagnosis is that the existing cancer is identified as Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). RMS is atype of cancer that develops in soft tissues, most commonly in children and teenagers, though it can affect adults as well.

Now, Nada is in her early cycle of chemotherapy, and we’ll continue with every treatment she needs.

As a dad, as the head of our little family, my only thought is to give her the best care and keep her world filled with love. My wife and I have been devastated—but we’ve also been given a new perspective on what matters in life. **Caring for Nada has reminded us that every moment is precious, every hug is a blessing**.

I’ve seen my wife struggle even more deeply. Every visible change in Nada’s physical and mental condition shakes her to the core. And yet, she shows up every single day, navigating appointments, treatment plans, and endless moments of uncertainty. She’s a strong fighter in her own right.

As for me personally, I’m deeply grateful to my family, relatives, and friends for their support. Even a simple “Pras, aman?” means more than you can imagine. It’s a reminder that we’re not alone in this.

Financially, we’re supported by family and insurance, and I’m also thankful for the projects coming in at my copywriting agency. My clients’ trust helps us keep moving forward—_and in a way, helps Nada in her recovery too_.

Going forward, I welcome any form of encouragement. It keeps me grounded in what matters most.

Family,  
proximity,  
and the people who truly care.

Best regards for you and your family.  
_Hug them tight._
