UX Writing is fundamentally about two things: Clue and Cue.

That's it. That's the whole game.

Let me break this down.

## The Clue: Telling Users What They Have

The "Clue" is about orientation. It's telling users "here's where you are, here's what's happening, here's what you have." It's the context, the situation, the landscape of the digital environment they're navigating.

You know how you feel when you walk into a party where you don't know anyone, and there's no host to greet you? That's a digital product without good clues. You're just... there, wondering if you should grab a drink or back slowly toward the exit awkwardly.

**Bad clue writing sounds like**:  
- "Error 5392 has occurred."  
- "Your request cannot be processed at this time."  
- "Action completed."

**Good clue writing sounds like**:  
- "Your payment information is saved and ready to go."  
- "We need a few more details before we can create your account."  
- "All set! Your order will arrive on Thursday."

Without proper clues, users are essentially wandering around a dark room with furniture in it. Sure, they might eventually figure out where the light switch is, but not before stubbing their toe on the coffee table and cursing your entire product team.

## The Cue: Prompting Users to Act

The "Cue" is the trigger for action. It's the gentle (or sometimes not-so-gentle) nudge that says, "Here's what you should do next." It's the directional signal, the invitation to interact, the moment where potential energy becomes kinetic.

**Bad cue writing sounds like**:  
- "Submit"  
- "OK"  
- "Next"  

and yes, I am guilty of writing copy like that too!

**Good cue writing sounds like**:  
- "Find your new home"  
- "See what friends are sharing"  
- "Continue to payment"

A cue without a clue is like someone shouting "Jump!" at you without telling you if you're jumping onto a trampoline or off a cliff. A clue without a cue is like someone describing a delicious meal in excruciating detail but never inviting you to eat it, and I know it sucks.

## The Delicate Dance of Clue and Cue

Here's where it gets interesting (and where most products mess it up). The clue and cue have to work together in perfect harmony, like peanut butter and jelly, or anxiety and deadline day.

**Too much clue**: 'Your shopping cart currently contains 3 items: 1 pair of wireless headphones (black) added on May 9th at 3:42 PM, 1 phone charger (white) added on May 9th at 3:45 PM, and 1 screen protector (clear) added on May 9th at 3:47 PM. The subtotal is Rp700.000 before applicable taxes and shipping costs which will be calculated at checkout based on your location and chosen shipping method.'

**Too much cue**: 'Buy now! Checkout here! Complete your purchase! Don't miss out! Finalize order! Confirm selection!'

**Just right**: 'Your cart (3 items, Rp700.000) is ready for checkout.'

When UX writing fails at either clue or cue, users get stuck in digital quicksand. And when users get stuck, they don't blame themselves (despite what your product team might think). They blame OUR product!

- Ever abandoned a shopping cart because the checkout process was confusing?  
- Ever given up on signing up for a service because you couldn't figure out what information they wanted?  
- Ever deleted an app because you couldn't figure out how to perform a basic function?  

That's the cost of poor clue and cue.

The silent UX Writer is the unsung hero of your digital experience, and the irony is that when UX writing is done perfectly, nobody notices it. Like good plumbing, you only think about it when something goes wrong.

The best UX writers are invisible guides, leading users through digital experiences so seamlessly that the users feel like they're discovering everything on their own. It's like being at a party with the perfect host who introduces you to everyone, makes sure your drink is always full, but never makes you feel like you're being managed.

Coming to think of it, I missed a lot of parties.  

## In Conclusion, Words Matter, People

**So next time you're designing a digital product, or reviewing one, or using one and feeling frustrated, think about the clue and cue**. Are users being told what they have and what they can do? Are they being oriented and then activated?

Because at the end of the day, all the fancy animations and sleek interfaces in the world won't save a product if users are standing around thinking, "Wait, what am I looking at and what am I supposed to do with it?"

And that, my friends (and my future clients), is the Clue & Cue Theory of UX Writing. Use it wisely, and may your users never again stare at your interface with that look of confused desperation we've all worn while trying to figure out how to unsubscribe from yet another newsletter.

Kindly remember that in the digital world, words aren't just decoration. They're the invisible architecture that either guides users home or leaves them lost in the woods.
