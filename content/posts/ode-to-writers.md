To those who wield words like master craftsmen,  
Who've spent years honing their skill in the trenches of product design--  
You understand the weight of your craft.


You know how poorly chosen words can cascade into confusion,  
How awkward syntax in a PRD can multiply into months of misalignment.  
You recognize the magnetic pull of the right phrase that draws clicks..  
..and the jarring halt when copy stumbles on the user's journey.


Perhaps your impact on revenue remains invisible on spreadsheets.  
But, your words ripple through decisions, ready or not.  
Perhaps recognition eludes you--  
Too many brilliant wordsmiths I've known have shown the door,  
When I wished them standing ovations instead.


Here's to the writers who've ventured down different paths,  
When opportunity beckoned or hope faded.  
Trust in this: your talent wasn't wasted, your efforts not in vain.  
You are the good writers who tried.


And here's to all who understand that writing is alchemy,  
Transforming the ordinary into gold.  
Lifting the spirits of those seeking guidance.  
Illuminating pathways for families navigating life's maze.  
Building bridges where there were only chasms before.


Your words matter.  
Your craft matters.  
In a world drowning in noise,  
jargons, and corporate talks.  
You are the clarity we desperately seek.
