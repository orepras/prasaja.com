# Product Requirements Document: Writing Guidelines Tool

You can visit [customizable writing guidelines here](/writing-guidelines).


## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The Writing Guidelines Tool is a web-based application that enables individuals and teams to create, customize, and export comprehensive writing guidelines for brand communications. Unlike static style guides, this tool provides an interactive interface for defining and documenting all aspects of voice, tone, grammar, and terminology with real-time visualization and easy export options.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Content inconsistency is a significant challenge for growing organizations. As teams scale, maintaining a consistent brand voice becomes increasingly difficult without proper documentation. Traditional solutions (static PDFs, shared docs) quickly become outdated, are difficult to reference, and lack contextual examples. Writers and content creators need a flexible, comprehensive tool to establish, document, and share communication standards.

### 1.3 User Personas

**Primary:**
- **ME**
- **Content Strategists & UX Writers:** Professionals who establish content standards and need to document them in a shareable, comprehensive format.
- **Marketing Teams:** Groups responsible for maintaining brand consistency across various channels.
- **Product Teams:** Cross-functional teams creating user-facing content who need alignment on writing approach.

**Secondary:**
- **Freelancers:** Independent professionals who need to quickly understand a client's voice and tone requirements.
- **Agencies:** Creative teams working with multiple clients, needing to document different brand guidelines.

## 2. Product Goals
