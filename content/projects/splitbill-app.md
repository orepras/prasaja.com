# SplitBill: Making Expense Sharing Effortless

## The Problem: Tracking Bills Is Hard

Manual bill splitting among friends is tedious, error-prone, and often leads to awkward financial situations.

Dividing expenses when dining out or sharing costs in groups typically involves complex mental calculations, manual data entry, and tracking who ordered what. This creates friction in social situations, wastes time, and frequently results in uneven distributions where some people pay more than their fair share.

And let's be honest‚Äîthis frustration came from our own shitty experiences too!

We created Splitbilll.app that makes sharing easy. In fact, people don't need to log in to use it, they can enter via guest mode.

## Meet Team Aethrix

I joined a fullstack javascript development bootcamp in Devscale, and the experience is awesome! I assigned to the team that keep the whole 2 months always fascinated, and everyone in it contribute greatly!

We are a team of aspiring full-stack developers from DevScale Batch 8, working together to build a product that we want to use ourselves while solving real problems. Our team consists of:

- **Ariq**: Full-Stack Developer & DevOps
- **Wisnu**: Full-Stack Developer & AI Tools Researcher
- **Kukuh**: Full-Stack Developer & Auth/Account Manager
- **Prasaja**: Full-Stack Developer & Product

## Our Approach

As a team of full-stack developers, we're building SplitBill with a user-first mindset, focusing on seamless experiences that remove financial friction from social gatherings. Our philosophy is simple: scanning receipts, tracking items, and managing money should be easy, transparent, and stress-free.

We believe technology should handle the tedious calculations so people can focus on enjoying their time together.

## The Solution: SplitBill.app

We've created an application that can do the following things:

1. **Automate data capture**: Leverage OCR technology to scan and extract itemized information from receipts, eliminating manual entry.

2. **Handle complex calculations**: Automatically manage tax distribution, service fees, and different splitting methods (by item, equal split, or percentage).

3. **Facilitate easy sharing**: Generate shareable payment summaries that can be distributed via common messaging platforms.

Our tagline says it all: **"Make your splitting bill easier, so your friendship can still hold strong without too much money talks."**

## Tech Stack

SplitBill is built using modern technologies:

- **Project tracker**: Basecamp
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **AI tools**: llamaparse
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Challenges We've Faced

Building SplitBill hasn't been without its difficulties:

1. **OCR accuracy**: Ensuring reliable text recognition across different receipt formats, lighting conditions, and languages.

2. **User experience complexity**: Balancing powerful features with an intuitive interface that requires minimal learning.

3. **Designing consistent UIs**: The project started directly in the code and the visual alignment came later.

## Our Wins

Despite the challenges, we've achieved several key milestones:

1. **Technical innovation**: Successfully implementing advanced OCR technology in a practical, everyday application that solves a genuine problem.

2. **Measurable time savings**: Reducing the average bill-splitting time from day after, to hours, to minutes.

3. **Easy, shareable results**: The split bill details can be shared without even logging in or scanning your KTP first (because we're not pinjol lol).

We've successfully implemented these core functions:

- Receipt scanning using llamaparse
- Upload receipt functionality
- SSO Google Sign-in
- Export as image result

## The Impact

SplitBill eliminates financial awkwardness from social situations by providing clear, fair payment distributions. By automating the tedious task of bill splitting, we're helping friends enjoy their time together without the stress of manual calculations.

Our app ensures that everyone pays exactly what they owe, preserving friendships and making group outings more enjoyable.
