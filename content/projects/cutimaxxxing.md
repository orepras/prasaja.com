So, who here has become an impromptu mathematician when calculating leave days? "If I take Thursday and Friday off, and there's a public holiday on Monday, that means I can get a 5-day break, right?"

I vividly remember the first time I shared my leave plans with my boss. It felt like a business strategy presentation, complete with ROI calculations:

> "I'm taking just 2 days off to get 5 days of vacation. That's 250% efficiency!"

Of course, the reasons for taking leave can't be ordinary either. If your boss is hard to crack, they'll definitely ask why, where, with whom, what for ‚Äì exhausting! Ugh!  

So, what's your most creative excuse when applying for leave? My friend once said they were "attending a cousin's graduation" when they were actually going to a music festival in Bali. Or the classic "I'm feeling ill" on Friday, to get a long weekend.

We've all been there.

That got me thinking, "Why isn't there a tool to help me plan our leave to give longer holiday?" And it turns out, there were a few. But none with the execution level that made me comfortable using it. So I tinkered with a side project called Cutimaxxxing (Maximum Leaveüî•üî•üî•), a simple website to help us all become strategy experts in planning holiday ahead.

I initially planned this side project just to show off and test how far my skills could go in understanding end-to-end product development. From my own pain points (as potential user), content and communication strategies, to the technical side with Next.js stack. Having just graduated from a fullstack JavaScript bootcamp at Devscale Indonesia, I felt itchy if I didn't create something.

I was confident that some people shared similar concerns, wanting to maximize their leave days but needing a good strategy. What I didn't expect was how many people would visit the Cutimaxxxing website at launch. At launch, Cutimaxxxing reached over 200,000 people on social media (whaaaat?) and got 2,300+ visitors to the website.

> I even had to turn off Vercel Analytics because I was afraid my billing would explode!

That kind of achievement is unheard of, really! And after conducting a brief personal analysis, I believe there were several factors:

1. First, I didn't try to be a hero by positioning myself as "the solution." I used the StoryBrand framework, positioning Cutimaxxxing as a "guide" helping you‚Äî**the employee who needs leave**‚Äîconquer the challenge of "limited leave allowance."

2. Second, this is a real problem we all face. Who doesn't want a long vacation with minimal leave days? üèñÔ∏è

3. Third, I focused intensely on user personas. From social listening alone, I could see many employees with tight leave allowances, team managers who need to arrange their staff's leave schedules, and HR professionals who need tools to help employees.

4. And my final analysis ‚Äì Cutimaxxxing's features are simple but hit the mark:

- An easy-to-view national holiday calendar
- A leave calculator that provides recommendations for the best strategy
- Leave application templates in various "languages" (from casual to very formal for rigid bosses)

As a side note, I'm not sure what kind of achievement this is, but I managed to maintain a speed insights score of 100 for experience. I understood what kind of content was needed without risking making the website heavy. Very satisfying to see the greens!

The stories from people made me laugh too. Some employees actually submitted the template letter using the Javanese (krama inggil) template available on Cutimaxxxing. üòÇ

Now for the closing section, here's what I learned through building this product.

Simple products can create impact if they:
- Solve a real problem that we all experience
- Are very easy to use (almost-zero learning curve)
- Have a story that makes people think "This is **exactly** it!"

Who knows, you might find a "super long vacation" strategy this year by taking just a few days off.

Oh, and I'd love to know, what's your strategy for your next leave?

Share it with me~
