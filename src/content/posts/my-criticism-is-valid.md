# My Criticism Is Extremely Valid, Obviously: A Field Guide to the New Age of Unproven Expertise

> Disclaimer: I got inspired to write this by an interaction in X. You might know what. Just scroll past my biggest quote post and dig deeper. Oh, and I hate the emoji in this title (but it gives the exact vibe of this whole essay)

There's a new species in the product world. They spawn in Slack threads (ew), emerge in Figma comments, and apparently, also destined to publicly critique the work of someone who's been building real products since the era when user onboarding meant "good luck."

Their natural tagline? maybe..  
"All bacot, no builds."

We've all met this wunderkind. If you're lucky, you've only seen them in the wild once or twice. If you're unlucky, they've commented on your design file, questioning your content hierarchy because they once skimmed an article titled "Why Good Design Matters." They didn't read it, of course. They just saw the title and assumed everything that followed was self-explanatory.

But let's explore their worldview, because it's fascinating. According to this species of newcomer, the rules of gravity do not apply. They float above the rest of us with a serenity that can only come from never having shipped anything personally, never having dealt with real users, and never having been roasted by an angry PM because your "cute" tooltip broke the checkout flow for 30 percent of customers.

This essay is dedicated to them.  
To the brave.  
To the bold.

To the people who say, with chest-out confidence  
"My criticism is very valid and I don't have to prove anything."

## The Sacred Art of Unresearched Critique

Let's start with the basics from my expertise in UX Writing POV. Real UX writers and content designers go through a whole process. User research, problem framing, content testing, iteration, alignment with design, alignment with product, alignment with legal. Then they fight with engineering for a week over whether the string should be "Continue" or "Next." It's a whole thing. It's a profession built on humility and evidence.

But our new hero? They don't need ANY of that. They operate from pure instinct and disruptive energy. Cool banget, pokoknya.

Your onboarding flow is three steps? Well, according to their intuition _(which is conveniently never wrong)_ it should be one step. Or seven. They're not sure, but they definitely feel strongly that whatever you built is wrong.

And because they "feel strongly," that alone should qualify as data. You see, some of us gather feedback from users, but others gather it from vibes. And vibes are notoriously efficient. They require no recruitment, no time, no budget, and no prototype links. Just a chair, a coffee, and the unmistakable sense that they know better.

If only research teams had known this earlier. Think of the savings because you certainly can save for a mid-size yacht.

## "I Don't Need to Prove It. Trust Me!"

One of the most inspiring qualities of the snarky one is that they believe expertise works in reverse. The less you know, the more objective you are. You haven't built a product before? Excellent. That means you're untainted by "industry bias." You've never spoken to a user? Even better. That means you approach things with "fresh eyes."

kha*  
(dry cough)

You've never had your content picked apart by legal?

Never had a localisation team rewrite your perfect sentence because it breaks in English?

Never wrestled with making error states both clear and non-blaming?

Never built accessibility into content from day one?

Perfect. You are now the purest mind in the entire UX ecosystem.

Why would you need proof for your criticism when your only qualification is the sheer boldness of making it?

Experienced engineers, designers, and writers are burdened with things like justification, metrics, and impact. They've been around long enough to know that saying "This is bad" isn't enough. You need to say why, and how to fix it, and how long it will take, and who's blocked by whom. But the newbie? They're blessedly free from this weight.

They're not giving solutions, just a truth bombs.

## The Content Designer's Nightmare Scenario

Allow me to paint a picture, by text.

You've been working on a thoughtful, user-tested piece of product for a new feature. You've spoken to PMs, engineers, support teams. You've tested it with users who don't say things like "this button slaps" or "bro that CTA goes hard." You've balanced functionality, usability, clarity, tone, brevity, accessibility, and cross-platform consistency.

You're feeling good.

You post it internally. Just a simple Slack thread. You even add context, because you're a responsible adult: target audience, use cases, constraints, research findings.

Then, from the grass, emerges The Cool Guy.

He has never spoken in this channel before.

He says, "lol this text feels awkward."

Awkward.

Awkward to whom? Hah? Why? In what context? How much the coffee cost? Compared to what? Does he have alternatives? Has he tested it? Does he understand the constraints?

It doesn't matter.

He adds, "idk man, maybe just make it more engaging or something."

And this—_this_—is considered a valid contribution.

Meanwhile, you have a legal review tomorrow.

## Critiquing Without Context is A Timeless Craft

UX writing, Product design, and Product suffers from same plagues too. Some people spend years learning interaction design patterns, designing information architecture, studying cognitive load, and fine-tuning micro-interactions.

And yet here comes the newbie.

"I think the sidebar are cringe."

Ah yes. That's helpful.

No need to consider platform guidelines, accessibility affordances, brand direction, your mom's advice, or component library constraints. We should all simply obey the decree of the Sidebar Prophet.

Or my favorite:

"This screen looks empty. Add more stuff."

Minimalism? Kosong banget nih? Negative space? Visual hierarchy? No thank you. More boxes, more text, more icons shaped like the developer's favorite animal, the confusing blob.

## The Irony, Of Course

The biggest irony is once these same newbies actually ship something—_anything_—they immediately understand the horror of being critiqued without context.

They discover the cold slap of production bugs.

The reality of release timelines.

The pressure of "Why is this confusing?" feedback from users who do not care about your clever phrasing.

The 200 comments on the design handoff file.

The eleventh-hour API change that breaks your perfect UX copy.

The PM asking for numbers on your word choice.

And then—magically—humility appears.

## But Until Then…

Let us appreciate these bold critics.

Their courage.

Their unearned confidence.

Their commitment to sharing hot takes with absolutely no obligation to support them.

After all
"My criticism is very valid and I don't have to prove anything."

It's the new industry motto of people who haven't been burned by a production incident yet.

And honestly, maybe we should let them enjoy this phase.

Because once reality hits, they will join the rest of us in the prod of larger scale—writing, testing, debating, iterating, documenting, apologizing to engineers (sorry y'all!), updating Jira tickets, rewriting microcopy because the layout changed, negotiating character limits, and proving things over and over again.

But until that day, may their critiques be plentiful and their contributions… aspirational.

And before we close, I leave you with a humble request. Please quote part of this article and spread it, then respond without full context as every superficial influencer does.
