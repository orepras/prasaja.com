The endless debates about which professional tools are superior got me thinking, and that's why I decided to write this article.

Learning to use tools efficiently is definitely important in our daily work. But here's the thing ‚Äì without solid foundational skills, even the best tools won't get you very far.

I've been fascinated watching buzzwords like Agile, Design Sprint, and Lean gain tremendous popularity in recent years. Naturally, I was curious to try them out in my own product development work. Let's be honest ‚Äì many companies and teams still cling to conventional methods like waterfall, resisting the need to experiment with new methodologies or tools to keep pace with rapidly evolving business and technology trends.

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"

This mindset was deeply ingrained in me for the first 25 years of my life. Then I started regularly reading Medium articles about various methodologies that streamline work across different business lines.

Just like opinions, we should always question the effectiveness of methodologies and tools.

Do they actually make us more productive? Can they help our team be more creative? Will they make our products more valuable to customers?

Every time I read about Agile, Design Sprint, or Lean on Medium, there's always someone in the comments section challenging the approach. They claim the methods aren't effective, can't be measured for success, involve too much bureaucracy, and so on.

While many of these opinions lack substance, I do agree with one comment I've seen.
Tools are just aids that will eventually be replaced by better, more effective, and more useful versions. Arguing that certain tools are perfect is just a waste of time. Focus on developing fundamental skills and use tools to help you grow and solve business problems effectively.

This made me constantly question what skills I should be honing. Especially after discussing career development with various experts and asking what skills are most important, the majority emphasized the need for specific abilities before mastering tools that make work easier.

## Here are some essential skills to focus on:

## Time Management

This is crucial whether you're handling daily tasks, working for someone else, or developing your own business. Being able to predict how long tasks will take and planning your activities accordingly will make you more comfortable and organized in everything you do.

## Problem Solving

Each person has a unique approach to solving problems based on their perspective. Some can solve problems simply, while others have structured but time-consuming processes.
Many believe that the most effective problem-solving often comes from "lazy" people. Is that true? Look around and try solving problems that arise to see for yourself.

## Open-Mindedness

Being open-minded is easy ‚Äì except for those whose egos are denser than a rock.
Being open-minded isn't just about letting outside information in; it's about processing that information and considering its benefits. If you only consume similar information and surround yourself with people who share your viewpoint, you're less likely to truly be open-minded. The solution? Make it a habit to respect different opinions and perspectives.

## Critical Thinking

Critical thinking means always ensuring that the information you receive actually benefits your life. And I'm not just talking about positive benefits ‚Äì negative impacts can often have an even greater influence on a person's life and decisions.

The "YES MAN" mentality with one-way communication prevents many organizations from developing mentally and professionally. Only certain parties reap the benefits while others just follow orders.

## Collaboration

Collaborative skills? Hmm, how to explain this...
If someone always prefers to work alone without wanting others involved, that's selfish.
If someone always delegates their tasks to others without doing any work themselves, that's inconsiderate.

Being collaborative means communicating effectively and being open to delegating tasks according to people's capacities while working together with others.
There are many more skills worth developing. Various articles emphasize the importance of certain skills for the future. Whatever your field, I believe there's always room for skill development.

Tools are just aids to achieve your goals. Sometimes they're useful, sometimes innovative, and sometimes you're forced to use them because there's nothing better available. The abundance of tools can be confusing, especially with the challenge of adapting in today's fast-paced era.

Over the past year, I've seriously focused on improving my time management, problem-solving, and collaboration skills while working with various product development teams as a Design Sprint facilitator. I'm convinced that Design Sprint as a methodology will continue to evolve significantly to create the best and most effective version.

What if there's a more effective, cheaper, or more beneficial method out there?
I'll continue researching, considering, and evaluating what makes life easier. The key is not to be blinded by one thing (in this context, professional tools), and especially not to blame or look down on others because they don't agree with the tools you use.
