If I look back at the past year, I realize I’ve accomplished more and deepened my expertise far beyond what I ever did during my years of full-time employment. Heheheh it’s almost ironic — stepping out of the comfort of a company didn’t make me less productive and it made me more curious, deliberate, and free to explore what my role as a UX Writer could truly become.

I began the early last year by asking a simple question, "What if documenting copy could be as systematic as documenting code?"
That question led me down the rabbit hole of JSON structures, AI-assisted workflows, and developer-friendly writing systems — **not just for efficiency, but for clarity**. I wasn’t just writing microcopy anymore, I was designing the infrastructure that makes good writing repeatable, scalable, and collaborative.

## Accessibility: Seeing Beyond the Screen

One of the most transformative experiences this year came from handling an accessibility project with [Suarise](https://suarise.com/) (shout to [Rahma Utami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahmaut/)). It is _not_ only about fixing contrast or adding alt text, I witnessed how people with disabilities interact with products that were never built with them in mind.

I saw how a single design decision (a color, a label, a missing focus state) could completely block someone from completing a task. That realization changed how I view my craft. I began contributing to the project’s content fundamentals, making sure every message, instruction, and label not only read well but also worked for everyone, hopefully.

That project also inspired me to learn Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia (BISINDO). I completed my Level 1 certification thanks to Suarise for sponsoring me!

Learning sign language reshaped how I think about language itself. It’s concise, direct, and structured in ways that show how humans don’t need filler to understand each other, just intention and clarity. It’s communication stripped down to its essence.

## Community, Conversations that Spark Meaning

This year also reminded me how important community is. Through **Sit Talk Design** that [Dimas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimaswibowo55/) build, I hosted offline meetups for designers, writers, researchers, everyone basically. people who, like me, just wanted a space to talk without the formality of panels or keynotes (or I'm just too lazy to host a formal events, lol).

We shared stories and hours of genuine conversation. No slides, no decks, just people exchanging stories, frustrations, and sparks of inspiration. Those meetups became something I deeply treasure. They reminded me that design isn’t built in solitude, it’s shaped by stories we tell each other.

## Learning New Languages, Human and Machine

I also pursued something I’d long dreamed of **learning how to code**. I joined a [Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp at Devscale](https://devscale.id/), and by the end, I graduated with Honor predicate. Together with my batchmates, we built a split-bill app, a small but complete product that forced me to think not only as a writer or designer, but as a builder.

> Oh hey, this website is also how I implement the knowledge from the bootcamp!

Learning how developers think has been one of the best things I’ve done for my career. It gave me the vocabulary to translate empathy into logic, and ideas into something tangible.

## Writing That Travels

Somewhere in between projects and experiments, [I published an article on the UX Content Collective](https://uxcontent.com/content-design-json/), an international platform for UX writers and content designers. It started with a small post I made in LinkedIn about documenting copy in JSON. A few weeks later, [Patrick Stafford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-stafford/) from UXCC reached out and invited me to turn it into a full article.

I said yes, not knowing that it would connect me to writers and content designers around the world. The day it was published, my inbox filled with connection requests and kind messages from people who resonated with that idea. It was surreal!
It made me realize that the things we quietly tinker with might just be what others are waiting to hear.

So hey, publish that draft of yours.

## Projects That Make Me Proud

Among the projects I handled, one that stood out was writing the website copy for [Tokotype](https://tokotype.com/), a rebranding project for one of the best type foundries in Indonesia — the same studio whose fonts appear in countless cool products and creative works.
To be trusted with words that represent designers’ favorite fonts? That’s an honor. So, thanks mas [Gumpita](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gumpita/) to invite me to the project!

Another milestone was conducting a workshop at Blibli, where I shared my principles for documenting UX content and building style guides with JSON. I expected the session to be too technical, but the enthusiasm from their UX Writing team from start to finish proved otherwise, **writers today are ready to speak the language of systems**.

## Building Tools for Writers Like Me

All these experiences naturally led to something I’ve been quietly building, a set of tools for end-to-end UX writing workflows.

They live on my website now, helping writers:

- Build Style Guides from scratch
- Shape Voice & Tone with 16 available tonal dimensions
- Set clear Grammar & Mechanics standards
- Collect and document Product Terminology

They’re not meant to replace craft, they’re meant to make the craft visible, tangible, and easy to maintain. I built them because I wanted every writer who works with designers and developers to feel confident saying, “Yes, our content is documented, consistent, and ready for scale.”

## Looking Back, Moving Forward 😎

This year has been one long experiment.  
Part writing, part coding, part teaching, part listening.  
But if there’s one theme that ties it all together, it’s continuity.  
Every project, workshop, and conversation taught me that writing isn’t just what we put on screen, it’s how we connect meaning across people, disciplines, and perspectives.

And maybe that’s what I’m most proud of.
Not just what I built, but how I’ve started to redefine what it means to be a UX Writer in this era. I don't think only 'UX Writer' can define what I do. I'm the one who can code, document, teach, and still tell stories that move people, so maybe anything that fits the descriptions.

Here’s to another year of building, learning, and writing things that matter.

Thanks for reading this, friend. Hope you have great things ahead.  
Next time we meet, let's do a handshake and big hug (in that order).
