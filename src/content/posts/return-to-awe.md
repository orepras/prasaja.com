People love to say "life is short" as if it were a poetic idea, but when you actually feel time slipping through your fingers, the phrase stops being inspirational and becomes a reminder, and sometimes a painful one. In the last few months, my axis of urgency shifted. I've spent enough nights in hospital corridors, enough mornings counting hours, enough afternoons hoping for good news, to understand that time doesn't stretch the way we think it does. It contracts and tightens around what matters. And when that happens, the world stops being something to conquer and becomes something to notice.

So here I am, returning to the workforce—_not as the same person who left_, but as someone relearning how to pay attention. I'm back as a contractor, commuting again, showing up to an office in Blok M where the air is thick with Transjakarta's CO₂ and caffeine, ambition, also the mild arrogance of trendy districts *cough. I step out of the MRT, surrounded by skyscrapers and optimism, and sometime realize how easy it is to become the kind of adult who forgets to look up.

And I don't want to be that adult, ew.

## The Danger of Becoming Unimpressed

One of the quiet tragedies of growing older is becoming "unimpressed" by things that once amazed us. The way the city lights used to feel magical. The way a new job used to spark daydreams. The way buildings used to tower above us instead of simply "existing."

We say we've matured, but sometimes we've just numbed ourselves.

We've trained our senses to filter out anything "unnecessary", _which unfortunately includes the small miracles that make life feel full_. We bury ourselves in work, that 'tk tk tk' in Slack pings, WhatsApp notifs, in deliverables, in the illusion that staying busy equals being valuable. Or maybe when we sit on airplanes and never look out the window (Oh I miss holiday flights). We walk past skyscrapers without acknowledging their height. We hear a piece of music and treat it like background noise.

Somewhere along the way, noticing becomes a luxury.  
And wonder becomes a stranger.

But I've seen what happens when life forces you into rooms where you'd trade anything just to experience something ordinary again. A walk in the sun. A good cup of coffee. The sight of your daughter laughing. A Monday morning that doesn't feel like a burden. Those moments change you. They sharpen something in you that you didn't realize had gone dull.

Coming back to work now, I don't want to simply "return to normal." I want to _return to awe_.

## Awe is a Mood, Awe is a Practice.

Awe doesn't show up politely like permisi. It doesn't schedule itself between meetings (like duh?!). You have to meet the world halfway. You have to practice noticing.

These days, walking through Blok M feels different. Everything is too loud, too fast, too bright yet somehow exactly the reminder I need. The chaos of ojol horns, the smell of aisle's coffee shops opening for the day, the sidewalks full of people trying to be someone… it's easy to drown in it. But if you pause for half a second, you notice that the city is alive in a way that mirrors your own returning aliveness.

My awe is subtle.

Sometimes it's the quiet pleasure of seeing morning sunlight reflect off a building you used to ignore. Sometimes it's the tiny ritual of buying coffee from the same stall every day and realizing the barista remembers your order. Sometimes it's watching people rush to work and wondering about their stories. What they're hoping for, what they're trying to escape, what they're building.

As writers, our job—our real job, beyond deliverables and deadlines—is to stay awake to these moments. To see the details others miss. To study textures, sounds, glances, atmospheres. To understand that meaning often hides in what looks ordinary.

Awe is fuel.  
Wonder is data.

## Returning to Work with New Eyes

Uhh.. it's just an expression, I'm not actually buying a new eyes, 

People assume returning to work after a turbulent chapter means restarting where you left off. But in reality, you come back carrying a different set of lenses. You see things you didn't see before. You question things you previously accepted. You soften in ways you didn't think you could.

Entering an office now is *a professional ritual and beyond*; it's a small miracle of normalcy. Being able to focus on tasks again feels like a privilege. Sitting in meetings doesn't automatically drain me; sometimes it even reminds me of how alive the world is, and how many lives intersect to make a single product, system, or line of copy work.

Maybe that's the real lesson?
Awe grows when you realize how interconnected everything is.

I notice people more. The way the security guard greets everyone with the same calm energy every morning (except that one who always give me side-eye? why?). The way designers argue passionately about pixels because they care about the experience someone else will have. The way engineers explain constraints like they're translating logic into human language.

It's easy to get cynical. It's easy to say "it's just work." But you can also choose to see it differently as a collection of humans trying their best to build something useful.

And that, too, is wonder.

## The Fleeting Nature of Moments

The fact that moments are fleeting is the whole point.

If everything lasted forever, nothing would feel meaningful. The skyscraper looks different every time the sun moves. The mood of the city shifts from morning to evening. Your daughter grows, your routines change, your capacity stretches and shrinks. You only walk this version of your life once.

So for me, returning to awe is partly a rebellion. A refusal to let adulthood flatten my senses. A conscious act of tuning into the frequency of the world around me. *A disciplined softness, if that makes sense*.

Choosing to look up, even when everyone else keeps their eyes on the ground. To be moved, even at the risk of looking sentimental. To be present, even though presence makes you realize how fragile everything is.

And honestly, that fragility makes the world more beautiful.

## Relearning Wonder as a Working Adult

This new chapter of being a contractor, navigating Jakarta's most energetic areas, balancing deadlines with personal storms, it's a return to feeling, beyond 'just a return to work.'

I want to walk into each day with the humility of someone who knows how quickly life can change, and with the curiosity of someone who's still learning to see. I want to write better, think deeper, observe slower. I want my sense of self—not just my _career_—to evolve because my senses are awake again.

The world responds—not by becoming more beautiful, but by allowing you to notice the beauty that was always there.
