Here's something I wish someone had told me earlier that I don't owe anyone a linear story.

We're constantly fed this narrative that life is supposed to follow some predetermined script. You go to school, pick a career, climb that ladder, maybe switch companies once or twice if you're feeling adventurous, and then retire with a gold watch and a sense of accomplishment. It's neat. It's tidy. It fits perfectly on a LinkedIn profile.

But what if your story doesn't look like that? What if you're on your fourth career pivot (hehe), your third city, your tenth version of yourself?

What if the person you were last year feels like a stranger, and the person you're becoming is still a mystery?

The older I get, the more I realize that reinvention is possible and (kinda) necessary. We're not meant to be static beings, frozen in the amber of our twenty-something decisions.

_We're allowed to wake up one morning and realize that everything we thought we wanted doesn't fit anymore._

_We're allowed to change our habits, shift our mindsets, raise our standards, seek out new people, pivot to entirely new careers._

_We're allowed to change today, tomorrow, and as many times as it takes to create the life we actually want, not the life we thought we were supposed to want._

And yet, when you start talking about change— _real, fundamental change_ —you'll notice something interesting. The advice starts rolling in. Suddenly, everyone has an opinion about your choices, your timing, your readiness. And the loudest voices often come from people who've walked the straightest paths.

I don't say this to diminish anyone's journey. A linear path isn't a lesser path. But there's something peculiar about receiving life advice from someone who's never had to rebuild from scratch, who's never felt the terror and exhilaration of not knowing what comes next, who's never had to sit with the discomfort of being a beginner again at thirty, or forty, or fifty.

They mean well, these advice-givers. They usually do. They'll tell you about stability and responsibility. They'll remind you about your age, your commitments, what people will think. They'll talk about the risks as if you haven't already catalogued them at 11pm when you couldn't sleep. They'll speak with the confidence of people who've never had to question whether the life they're living is actually theirs or just the default option they never thought to refuse.

And yea, I also learned that I don't have to appreciate unwanted advice.

You don't have to smile and nod and pretend that someone else's fear of change should dictate your capacity for it. You don't have to accept guidance from people who've never stood where you're standing, who've never felt that pull **toward something different, something truer, something more aligned with who you're becoming**.

Reinvention requires something that straight paths don't, **courage in the face of uncertainty**. It requires the willingness to be uncomfortable, to be judged, to be misunderstood. It requires faith in your own capacity to figure things out, even when you don't have a roadmap like any project do. It requires trusting that the mess is part of the process, that the detours aren't failures but discoveries.

The people who understand this (who really get it) are the ones who've lived it. They're the ones who've switched careers at thirty-five, who've moved across the country with no plan, who've left relationships that looked perfect on paper but felt hollow in practice. They're the ones who've rebuilt their lives from the foundation up, who've sat with the question "what now?" until it stopped being terrifying and started being exciting.

These are the people whose advice actually lands differently. Not because they have all the answers, but because they understand that there are no universal answers. They know that your life is yours to design, that your timeline doesn't need to match anyone else's, that your version of success might look nothing like what you were taught to aspire to.

So what does this mean for you, for me, for anyone standing at the edge of reinvention?

**It means we get to be explorers**. It means we get to approach life with curiosity rather than rigidity, with experimentation rather than perfection. It means we get to collect experiences, perspectives, skills, and stories that don't fit neatly into a single narrative arc. It means we get to be multiple people across our lifetime, each version informed by the last but not constrained by it.

It means we get to build lives that feel alive, that challenge us, that grow as we grow. Lives that might confuse people who prefer their stories straightforward. Lives that might not make sense to anyone who hasn't felt that deep, undeniable knowing that it's time to change.

And when the advice comes (because it will come) we get to filter it through our own experience. We get to ask "Does this person understand what I'm really trying to do? Have they navigated the kind of uncertainty I'm facing? Are they speaking from wisdom or from fear?" We get to say "thank you" and move on, saving our attention for the voices that actually resonate, that actually know what this journey requires.

You're never stuck.  
Not really.  
Not unless you accept the story that says you are.

You're allowed to change, to evolve, to become someone unrecognizable from who you were even yesterday. You're allowed to want more, different, better. You're allowed to reinvent yourself as many times as it takes.

The life you want is out there, waiting for you to be brave enough to reach for it, so let them in. And the only person who needs to understand why you're reaching is you.

Keep going, friend.
