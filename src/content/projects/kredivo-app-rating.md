# Kredivo App Rating Enhancement

## Project Overview

Kredivo, Indonesia's leading digital credit provider, faced a critical challenge in early 2024 when their app ratings began to decline. As a fintech platform that relies heavily on user trust and satisfaction, maintaining strong app ratings was crucial for continued growth and market leadership. This case study details how strategic UI copy and carefully planned user touchpoints helped revitalize Kredivo's app rating system.

## Challenge

In Indonesia's competitive fintech landscape, Kredivo encountered several critical issues:

- **Low user engagement with the app rating system**
- Declining app ratings due to technical bugs in early 2024
- Missed opportunities to capture user feedback at key moments
- Lack of strategic touchpoints for rating prompts
- User hesitation to provide ratings without clear context or motivation

## The Works

We developed a comprehensive approach to transform how Kredivo engages users for ratings:

### 1. Strategic Touchpoint Mapping

- Identified key moments in the user journey optimal for rating requests
- Created contextually relevant rating prompts
- Implemented timing-based triggers for rating requests

### 2. Persuasive UI Copy Development

- Crafted clear, motivational copy for rating prompts
- Developed user-centric messaging that emphasized value
- Created variations for different user scenarios

### 3. User Journey Integration

- Post-transaction rating opportunities
- Post-bill payment feedback collection
- Successful credit purchase follow-ups

## Content Strategy

## UI Copy Strategy

We developed copy that was:

- Contextual to the user's recent activity
- Appreciative of user participation
- Clear and concise in its request
- Emotionally resonant with the user's experience

## Tone of Voice

- Friendly and accessible
- Respectful of user time
- Grateful for user feedback
- Professional yet conversational

## User Touchpoints

Strategic placement of rating prompts at key moments:

1. Post-Purchase Success
   - Immediately after successful credit purchase
   - Following data package activation
   - After successful bill payments

## The Results

The strategic implementation led to significant improvements:

- Approximately 3,000 additional ratings month-over-month
- Improved app store rating trends
- Higher user engagement with feedback system
- More balanced and representative user feedback
- Increased positive ratings from satisfied users

## The Takeaway

This project demonstrated how strategic UI copy and carefully planned user touchpoints can significantly impact user engagement and app ratings. The success was built on:

- Understanding user psychology and behavior patterns
- Creating contextually relevant messaging
- Identifying optimal moments for engagement
- Developing clear and motivational copy
- Implementing systematic testing and optimization

The dramatic increase in monthly ratings proves that **technical solutions must be paired with thoughtful user experience design and strategic communication to achieve meaningful results**. This approach not only helped recover from the initial technical challenges but also established a sustainable system for ongoing user feedback collection and engagement.
