# UX Writing Leadership

I know this might seem unconventional for a portfolio, but as a lead UX writer, my primary role involves managing teams and refining the writing process, leaving little in the way of traditional artifacts. So, let me share a compelling story about my experience managing a dynamic team of four talented writers across Indonesia and Vietnam.

## Managing the Team

Managing a lean team of five writers has been one of the most rewarding challenges of my career. I remember when I was first entrusted with the responsibility, the excitement and the slight trepidation I felt. Building products with a small team meant we had to be incredibly efficient, maintaining high standards with minimal friction. But I was determined to make it work and to thrive.

From the outset, I knew that communication was key. I made it a point to create an open, supportive environment where everyone felt comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns. Weekly team meetings became our ritual, where we discussed our progress, brainstormed new ideas, and addressed any roadblocks. I encouraged each writer to take ownership of their projects while being available for guidance and support whenever needed.

## What Success Means For Us

One of the most crucial aspects of our success was the emphasis on improving readability. We wanted our products to be accessible and engaging to our audience. To achieve this, I introduced a series of workshops and training sessions focused on writing clarity, conciseness, and style. We dissected exemplary pieces of writing, analyzing what made them effective and how we could incorporate similar techniques into our work.

Feedback played a significant role in our process. I made it a priority to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback on each piece of writing. I believe in the power of positive reinforcement, so I always highlighted the strengths before delving into areas for improvement. My goal was to help each writer grow and develop their unique voice while adhering to our overall vision and standards.

Difficult conversations are inevitable in any team, but I approached them with empathy and understanding. When issues arose, I took the time to listen and understand the root causes. Instead of assigning blame, we focused on finding solutions together. This approach not only resolved conflicts but also strengthened our team cohesion.

## Feedback

My direct reports appreciated my approach to management. They often told me that they felt heard and valued, which motivated them to put forth their best efforts. The trust we built within the team was evident in our productivity and the quality of our work.

As we continued to refine our processes and enhance our writing, we saw tangible improvements in our products' reception. Our audience engaged more, feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and our readership grew. Each milestone we achieved was a testament to our hard work and collaboration.

Looking back, I'm proud of what we accomplished together in Kredivo Group.

Managing a lean team of writers required balancing many roles and responsibilities, but with a focus on communication, support, and continuous improvement, we not only managed but thrived. My teamâ€™s growth and success are a reflection of our collective effort and dedication, and it has been a privilege to lead such a talented group.
